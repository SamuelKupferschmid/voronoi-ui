# voronoi-ui
This Program creates a Voronoi diagram for a given set of Points, providing a simple User Interface.

The `Voronoi` Class implements the Fortune's Algorithm. The `Voronoi` Class implements the Fortune's Algorithm. 

The algorithm uses **O(n log n)** time and **O(n)** space.

## PriorityQueue ##
`PriorityQueue<T>` provides a Queue with its typical methods Like `void Enqueue(T item)` and `T Dequeue()`. The class implements a Binary Heap which has is very memory and computation efficient.
